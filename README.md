## 📌 Description  
This project implements **Image Captioning** using Deep Learning.  
It combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image feature extraction and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** for sequence modeling to generate descriptive captions for images.  

---

## ⚙️ Steps to Run  
1. Open the Google Colab notebook.  
2. Install dependencies (`TensorFlow`, `Keras`, etc.).  
3. Load dataset (Flickr8k, Flickr30k, or MS COCO).  
4. Extract features using a pre-trained CNN (InceptionV3 / ResNet).  
5. Train the Encoder-Decoder model with LSTM.  
6. Generate captions for unseen images.
